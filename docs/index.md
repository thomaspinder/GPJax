# GPJax

**Gaussian processes in JAX.**

GPJax is a didactic Gaussian process (GP) library in JAX, supporting GPU
acceleration and just-in-time compilation. We seek to provide a flexible API to
enable researchers to rapidly prototype and develop new ideas.

## "Hello, GP!"

Typing GP models is as simple as the maths we would write on paper.

```python
import gpjax as gpx

mean = gpx.mean_functions.Zero()
kernel = gpx.kernels.RBF()
prior = gpx.gps.Prior(mean_function=mean, kernel=kernel)
likelihood = gpx.likelihoods.Gaussian(num_datapoints=123)

posterior = prior * likelihood
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
k(\cdot, \cdot') & = \sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{\lVert \cdot- \cdot'\rVert_2^2}{2\ell^2}\right)\\
p(f(\cdot)) & = \mathcal{GP}(\mathbf{0}, k(\cdot, \cdot')) \\
p(y\,|\, f(\cdot)) & = \mathcal{N}(y\,|\, f(\cdot), \sigma_n^2) \\ \\
p(f(\cdot) \,|\, y) & \propto p(f(\cdot))p(y\,|\, f(\cdot))\,.
\end{aligned}

<!-- Every direct child of a `{grid}` must be a `{grid-item-card}` — anything else,
     including an HTML comment, emits `design.grid` and is fatal under `-W`. Hence the
     note about the benchmarks card living out here rather than beside it: that card
     deliberately has no `:link-type:`, because the ASV dashboard is copied into the
     built site by .github/workflows/build_docs.yml and is not a Sphinx document, so
     it cannot be resolved as one. sphinx-design emits a bare `:link:` verbatim, which
     keeps it relative and working in a local build too. -->

<!-- Sidebar grouping. `toctree_maxdepth = 0` in conf.py hands depth control to the
     `:maxdepth:` on each toctree below, and `globaltoc_expand_depth = 1` opens every
     top-level entry. So `:maxdepth: 2` is what puts a group's pages into the sidebar
     tree at all, and `:maxdepth: 1` keeps a group to a single line.

     Every group whose pages should be reachable from the sidebar therefore needs
     `:maxdepth: 2`. Groups that are a single page — Getting started, Migrations,
     Project — use `:maxdepth: 1`, because there are no children to reach.

     Note shibuya's fold state is uniform by depth: it cannot open some groups and
     leave others folded. That is why the migration guides live in one page with a
     `##` per release rather than as separate documents under a folded parent. The
     structure gives the tidy single sidebar line for free, with no JavaScript. -->
