# # Backend Module Design
#
# Download this notebook: {nb-download}`backend.ipynb`
#
# GPJax is built upon [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/) and
# [Paramax](https://github.com/danielward27/paramax). Equinox provides a lightweight
# module system for JAX, whilst Paramax adds support for constrained parameters via
# unwrappable types. This notebook provides a high-level overview of the backend module
# design in GPJax. For an introduction to Equinox, please refer to the
# [official documentation](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Parameters
#
# GPJax uses [Paramax](https://github.com/danielward27/paramax) to handle constrained
# parameters. As discussed in our [Sharp Bits -
# Bijectors Doc](../sharp_bits.md#bijectors), GPJax
# uses bijectors to transform constrained parameters to unconstrained parameters during
# optimisation. You may register the support of a parameter using our parameter types.
# To see this, consider the [`Constant`](#gpjax.mean_functions.Constant) mean function which
# contains a single constant
# parameter whose value ordinarily exists on the real line. We can register this
# parameter as follows:

# %%
constant_param = Real(1.0)
meanf = Constant(constant_param)
print(meanf)

# %% [markdown]
# However, suppose you wish your mean function's constant parameter to be strictly
# positive. This is easy to achieve by using the correct parameter type which, in this
# case, will be the [`PositiveReal`](#gpjax.parameters.PositiveReal). All parameter types are
# subclasses of Paramax's
# [`AbstractUnwrappable`](inv:paramax#paramax.wrappers.AbstractUnwrappable), which means they
# will be automatically transformed by GPJax
# during optimisation.

# %%
isinstance(PositiveReal(1.0), AbstractUnwrappable)

# %% [markdown]
# Injecting this newly constrained parameter into our mean function is then identical to before.

# %%
constant_param = PositiveReal(value=1.0)
meanf = Constant(constant_param)
print(meanf)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Parameter Transforms
#
# With a parameter instantiated, you likely wish to transform the parameter's value from
# its constrained support onto the entire real line. In GPJax, parameters store their
# values internally in unconstrained space. When you need the constrained value, call
# [`val`](#gpjax.parameters.val) on the parameter.

# %%
print("Constrained value:", val(constant_param))
print("Unconstrained (internal) value:", constant_param._unconstrained)
glue("backend-inv-softplus-one", f"{constant_param._unconstrained:.2f}", display=False)

# %% [markdown]
# We see here that the Softplus bijector is applied by the `PositiveReal` parameter type.
# Internally, the value 1.0 is stored as its inverse-softplus
# (~{glue:text}`backend-inv-softplus-one`), and calling
# `val` applies softplus to recover the original constrained value.
#
# `val` is the single rule you need to remember: **models are always held in their
# wrapped form** — the model you build, and the model `fit` hands back — and `val` is
# what you call at the point where a parameter meets arithmetic. It is safe to apply to
# anything, returning plain arrays and floats untouched, so there is never a need to
# check whether a value is wrapped first.
#
# For a value closer to 0, the transformation is more pronounced.

# %%
close_to_zero_param = PositiveReal(value=1e-6)
print("Constrained value:", val(close_to_zero_param))
print("Unconstrained (internal) value:", close_to_zero_param._unconstrained)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Transforming Multiple Parameters
#
# In the above, we transformed a single parameter. However, in practice your parameters
# may be nested within several functions e.g., a kernel function within a GP model.
# Fortunately, transforming several parameters is a simple operation that we here
# demonstrate for a conjugate GP posterior (see our [Regression
# Notebook](regression.py) for detailed
# explanation of this model.).

# %%
kernel = gpx.kernels.Matern32()
meanf = gpx.mean_functions.Constant()

prior = gpx.gps.Prior(mean_function=meanf, kernel=kernel)

likelihood = gpx.likelihoods.Gaussian()
posterior = likelihood * prior
print(posterior)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Summarising a model
#
# The `print(posterior)` output above is Equinox's representation: it exposes each
# parameter's *unconstrained* internal storage and conveys nothing about bijectors or
# trainability. For a human-readable overview, use
# [`gpx.summarise`](#gpjax.summary.summarise), which renders a flat
# table — one row per parameter — showing the constrained value, the bijector, whether
# the parameter is trainable, and its shape and dtype. It works on any GPJax model: a
# kernel, prior, posterior, likelihood, or variational family.

# %%
gpx.summarise(posterior)

# %% [markdown]
# `summarise` traverses the model as a PyTree, so composite objects (e.g. sum kernels)
# and frozen parameters are handled automatically — frozen rows are dimmed and reported
# as non-trainable. The same table backs `rich.print(posterior)` and Jupyter's automatic
# display, whilst `repr(posterior)` is left untouched.

# %% [markdown]
# Now contained within the posterior there are four parameters: the kernel's lengthscale
# and variance, the noise variance of the likelihood, and the constant of the mean
# function. With Equinox, we can partition the model into its array leaves and static
# structure using `eqx.partition`. This gives us direct access to the parameters as a
# PyTree.

# %%
params, static = eqx.partition(posterior, eqx.is_array)
print(params)

# %% [markdown]
# The `params` object behaves just like a PyTree and, consequently, we may use JAX's
# `tree_map` function to alter the values. The updated params can then be recombined
# with the static structure using `eqx.combine`. In the below, we increment each leaf
# by 1.

# %%
updated_params = jtu.tree_map(lambda x: x + 1, params)
print(updated_params)

# %% [markdown]
# Note what `eqx.partition` handed us: the array leaves are the parameters'
# **unconstrained** internals (`lengthscale._unconstrained` rather than `lengthscale`),
# so `tree_map` operates in unconstrained space. Adding 1 to the leaf of a
# unit lengthscale gives a constrained value of ~1.74, not 2.0, because the increment
# lands before the softplus. This is exactly the behaviour optimisation depends on —
# gradient steps are taken in the unconstrained space — but it does mean tree-mapping
# arithmetic over a model is not a way to *set* parameter values. To do that, construct
# a new parameter and swap it in with
# [`eqx.tree_at`](inv:equinox#equinox.tree_at).

# %% [markdown]
# Let us now use Equinox's `combine` function to reconstruct the posterior distribution
# using the updated parameters.

# %%
updated_posterior = eqx.combine(updated_params, static)
print(updated_posterior)

# %% [markdown]
# To read a constrained parameter value out of the model, reach for `val` at the point
# of use. Note that there is no separate step converting the model into some other
# form: `posterior` is the same wrapped object throughout, whether you are inspecting
# it, evaluating an objective on it, or passing it to `fit`. For a view of every
# parameter at once, use `gpx.summarise` as above.

# %%
print("lengthscale:", val(posterior.prior.kernel.lengthscale))
print("kernel variance:", val(posterior.prior.kernel.variance))
print("obs stddev:", val(posterior.likelihood.obs_stddev))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Fine-Scale Control
#
# One of the advantages of Equinox's partition mechanism is that we can gain fine-scale
# control over which parameters we extract. For example, suppose we only wish to extract
# those parameters whose support is the positive real line. This is easily achieved by
# providing a custom filter function to `eqx.partition`.

# %%
positive_reals, other_params = eqx.partition(
    posterior, lambda leaf: isinstance(leaf, PositiveReal)
)
print(positive_reals)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we see that we have two objects: one containing the positive real parameters
# and the other containing the remaining structure. This functionality is exceptionally
# useful as it allows us to efficiently operate on a subset of the parameters whilst
# leaving the others untouched. Looking forward, we hope to use this functionality in
# our [Variational Inference
# Approximations](uncollapsed_vi.py) to
# perform more efficient updates of the variational parameters and then the model's
# hyperparameters.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Equinox Modules
#
# To conclude this notebook, we will now demonstrate the ease of use and flexibility
# offered by Equinox modules. To do this, we will implement a linear mean function using
# the existing abstractions in GPJax.
#
# For inputs $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the linear mean function $m(x): \mathbb{R}^d \to
# \mathbb{R}$ is defined as:
#
# $$
# m(x) = \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^d \beta_i x_i
# $$ (eq-backend-linear-mean)
#
# where $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are the parameters of the
# mean function. Let's now implement that using Equinox.

# %%
class LinearMeanFunction(AbstractMeanFunction):
    intercept: Real | Float[Array, " O"]
    slope: Real | Float[Array, " D O"]

    def __init__(
        self,
        intercept: ScalarFloat | Float[Array, " O"] | Real = 0.0,
        slope: ScalarFloat | Float[Array, " D O"] | Real = 0.0,
    ):
        if isinstance(intercept, Real):
            self.intercept = intercept
        else:
            self.intercept = Real(jnp.array(intercept))

        if isinstance(slope, Real):
            self.slope = slope
        else:
            self.slope = Real(jnp.array(slope))

    def __call__(self, x: Num[Array, "N D"]) -> Float[Array, "N O"]:
        return val(self.intercept) + jnp.dot(x, val(self.slope))


# %% [markdown]
# As we can see, the implementation is straightforward and concise. The
# [`AbstractMeanFunction`](#gpjax.mean_functions.AbstractMeanFunction) is a subclass of
# [`eqx.Module`](inv:equinox#equinox.Module) and may, therefore, be
# used in any `partition` or `combine` call. Further, we have registered the intercept
# and slope parameters as [`Real`](#gpjax.parameters.Real) parameter types. This registers
# their value in the PyTree and means that they will be part of any operation applied to
# the model e.g., differentiation.
#
# Note the `val` calls in `__call__`: this is the one thing you must remember when
# writing your own kernels, mean functions and likelihoods. Every parameter read needs
# a `val`, because the module receives the model in its wrapped form. Forgetting is not
# a silent bug — a parameter is a PyTree node rather than an array, so the arithmetic
# raises `TypeError` immediately.
#
# To check our implementation worked, let's now plot the value of our mean function for
# a linearly spaced set of inputs ({numref}`fig-backend-linear-mean-function`).

# %% mystnb={"figure": {"caption": "The custom linear mean function evaluated on a linearly spaced grid of inputs, recovering the expected straight line.", "name": "fig-backend-linear-mean-function"}}
N = 100
X = jnp.linspace(-5.0, 5.0, N)[:, None]

meanf = LinearMeanFunction(intercept=1.0, slope=2.0)
plt.plot(X, meanf(X))
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# Looks good! To conclude this section, let's now parameterise a GP with our new mean
# function and see how gradients may be computed.

# %%
y = jnp.sin(X)
D = gpx.Dataset(X, y)

prior = gpx.gps.Prior(mean_function=meanf, kernel=gpx.kernels.Matern32())
likelihood = gpx.likelihoods.Gaussian(D.n)
posterior = likelihood * prior

# %% [markdown]
# We'll compute derivatives of the conjugate marginal log-likelihood
# ([`conjugate_mll`](#gpjax.objectives.conjugate_mll)). With Equinox and
# Paramax, this is straightforward: the loss takes the model exactly as it is, and
# `eqx.filter_value_and_grad` computes gradients with respect to the array leaves —
# which, as we saw above, are the parameters' unconstrained internals. The bijections
# are applied by the `val` calls inside the kernel, mean function and likelihood, so
# they sit on the differentiated path and are accounted for by the chain rule
# automatically.

# %%
def loss_fn(model, data: gpx.Dataset) -> ScalarFloat:
    return -gpx.objectives.conjugate_mll(model, data)


_, param_grads = eqx.filter_value_and_grad(loss_fn)(posterior, D)

# %% [markdown]
# In practice, you would wish to perform multiple iterations of gradient descent to
# learn the optimal parameter values. However, for the purposes of illustration, we use
# `eqx.apply_updates` in the below to update the model using its previously computed
# gradients. As you can see, Equinox makes it easy to apply updates directly to the
# model without manual split/merge operations.

# %%
LEARNING_RATE = 0.01
scaled_grads = jtu.tree_map(lambda g: LEARNING_RATE * g, param_grads)
optimised_posterior = eqx.apply_updates(posterior, scaled_grads)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we will plot the updated mean function alongside its initial form
# ({numref}`fig-backend-updated-mean-function`). Since the model
# is updated in-place via `eqx.apply_updates`, we can simply invoke it as normal.

# %% mystnb={"figure": {"caption": "The linear mean function before and after a single gradient step applied with eqx.apply_updates.", "name": "fig-backend-updated-mean-function"}}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(X, optimised_posterior.prior.mean_function(X), label="Updated mean function")
ax.plot(X, meanf(X), label="Initial mean function")

ax.set(xlabel="x", ylabel="m(x)")
