# # Count data regression
#
# Download this notebook: {nb-download}`poisson.ipynb`
#
# In this notebook we demonstrate how to perform inference for Gaussian process models
# with non-Gaussian likelihoods via Markov chain Monte
# Carlo (MCMC). We focus on a count data regression task here and use
# [BlackJax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/) for sampling. Where the
# [classification notebook](classification.py) settles for a point estimate of the
# latent function and a Gaussian approximation around it, we sample it here instead.

# ## Dataset
#
# For count data regression, the Poisson distribution is a natural choice for the likelihood
# function. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by
#
# $$
# p(y \,|\, \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{y} e^{-\lambda}}{y!},
# $$ (eq-poisson-pmf)
#
# where $y$ is the count and the parameter $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the rate of the Poisson
# distribution.
#
# We then set $\lambda = \exp(f)$ where $f$ is the latent Gaussian process. The exponential function
# is the _link function_ for the Poisson distribution: it maps the output of a GP to the positive
# real line, which is suitable for modeling count data. Our
# [likelihood guide](likelihoods_guide.py#link-functions) covers link functions and the
# role they play across GPJax's likelihoods.
#
# For this notebook, we use a real-world count dataset: the number of hot days
# recorded each year in Madrid, Spain, where we define a _hot_ day as one where the maximum temperature reached
# 30°C or more. The record spans 1960–2023 and is derived from the [ERA5
# reanalysis project](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview).
# Over this period the annual hot-day count rises from circa 49 days in 1960
# to over 80 days by 2020. Such count data may appropriately be modelled by a Poisson
# likelihood function.
#
# We use the calendar `year` as our input $\mathbf{X}$ and the hot-day count as the output
# $\mathbf{y}$. The input is standardised to make inference more reliable, and we store the data
# $\mathcal{D}$ as a GPJax [`Dataset`](#gpjax.dataset.Dataset) and retain the standardisation
# constants so predictions can be mapped back to calendar years.

# ## Gaussian Process definition
#
# We begin by defining a Gaussian process [prior](#gpjax.gps.Prior) with a radial basis function
# ([`RBF`](#gpjax.kernels.RBF)) kernel, chosen for the purpose of exposition. We adopt the
# [`Poisson`](#gpjax.likelihoods.Poisson) likelihood available in GPJax.

# %%
kernel = gpx.kernels.RBF()
meanf = gpx.mean_functions.Constant()
prior = gpx.gps.Prior(mean_function=meanf, kernel=kernel)
likelihood = gpx.likelihoods.Poisson()

# %% [markdown]
# We construct the [posterior](#gpjax.gps.NonConjugateModel) through the product of our
# prior and likelihood.

# %%
posterior = prior * likelihood
print(type(posterior))

# %% [markdown]
# Whilst the latent function is Gaussian, the posterior distribution is non-Gaussian
# since our generative model first samples the latent GP and propagates these samples
# through the likelihood function's inverse link function. This step prevents us from
# being able to analytically integrate the latent function's values out of our
# posterior, and we must instead adopt alternative inference techniques. Here, we show
# how to use MCMC methods.


# %% [markdown]
# ## MCMC inference
#
# An MCMC sampler works by starting at an initial position and
# drawing a sample from a cheap-to-simulate distribution known as the _proposal_. The
# next step is to determine whether this sample could be considered a draw from the
# posterior. We accomplish this using an _acceptance probability_ determined via the
# sampler's _transition kernel_ which depends on the current position and the
# unnormalised target posterior distribution. If the new sample is more _likely_, we
# accept it; otherwise, we reject it and stay in our current position. Repeating these
# steps results in a Markov chain (a random sequence that depends only on the last
# state) whose stationary distribution (the long-run empirical distribution of the
# states visited) is the posterior. For a gentle introduction, see the first chapter
# of [A Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.mcmchandbook.net/HandbookChapter1.pdf).
#
# ### MCMC through BlackJax
#
# Rather than implementing a suite of MCMC samplers, GPJax relies on MCMC-specific
# libraries for sampling functionality. We focus on
# [BlackJax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax/) in this notebook, which we
# recommend adopting for general applications. [NumPyro](inv:numpyro#index) is the other
# well-supported option, and the [NumPyro integration notebook](numpyro_integration.py)
# samples the kernel hyperparameters through it.
#
# We begin with a warm-up phase, in which BlackJax's window adaptation tunes the
# NUTS step size and mass matrix, before running the sampler for `num_samples` steps.
# The warm-up matters here as, with an untuned fixed step size, the sampler mixes poorly
# and the latent rate occasionally collapses towards zero, producing a spuriously wide
# and ragged lower credible band. In practice, drawing more samples across several
# chains will be necessary, but we truncate here due to CI/CD time limits.

# ### Sampler efficiency

# ## Prediction
#
# Having obtained samples from the posterior, we summarise the predictions at two
# levels for each (thinned) MCMC sample:
#
# 1. The posterior distribution of the rate $\lambda(\text{year}) = \exp(f(\text{year}))$, which quantifies the smooth,
#    uncertainty-aware intensity of the process. For each (thinned) MCMC sample we
#    draw latent functions $f^{\star}$ from the GP predictive at the test years and
#    push them through the exponential link, so the band reflects both hyperparameter
#    and latent-function uncertainty. Because the link is bounded below by zero, the
#    credible interval for $\lambda$ is naturally *asymmetric*: symmetric uncertainty
#    in the latent $f$ maps to a multiplicative, right-skewed spread in $\lambda$.
# 2. The posterior predictive over counts, which layers Poisson observation noise
#    on top of each sampled rate. This band is wider, and is built from
#    integer-valued count draws.
#
# An ideal Markov chain would have samples completely uncorrelated with their
# neighbours after a single lag. However, in practice, correlations often exist
# within our chain's sample set. A commonly used technique to try and reduce this
# correlation is _thinning_ whereby we select every $n$-th sample where $n$ is the
# minimum lag length at which we believe the samples are uncorrelated. Although further
# analysis of the chain's autocorrelation is required to find appropriate thinning
# factors, we employ a thin factor of 10 for demonstration purposes.
