# # Gridded Data with xarray
#
# Download this notebook: {nb-download}`xarray_workflow.ipynb`
#
# Climate and environmental data rarely arrive as a tidy matrix. They arrive as
# labelled [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/) objects: a temperature field over
# latitude and longitude, a covariate such as elevation, and gaps where a sensor
# failed or a cloud covered the scene. A GP in GPJax, on the other hand, consumes a
# [`Dataset`](#gpjax.dataset.Dataset) of flat inputs $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N
# \times D}$ and outputs $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 1}$.
#
# The [`gpjax.xarray`](../reference/xarray.md) module converts between the two at the
# edges of a workflow. In this notebook we
#
# 1. flatten a gappy, labelled field into a `Dataset` with
#    [`from_xarray`](#gpjax.xarray.from_xarray),
# 2. fit a GP exactly as we would on any other `Dataset`,
# 3. build inputs for a finer prediction grid with
#    [`GridSpec.inputs_for`](#gpjax.xarray.GridSpec.inputs_for), and
# 4. map the predictions, and joint posterior samples, back onto that grid with
#    [`GridSpec.to_xarray`](#gpjax.xarray.GridSpec.to_xarray).
#
# The module needs the optional extra: `pip install "gpjax[xarray]"`.

# ## A synthetic temperature field

# We simulate near-surface temperature on a regional latitude-longitude grid. It
# cools towards the pole and with elevation (a lapse rate of roughly 6.5 K per
# kilometre), with a smooth large-scale anomaly on top. Elevation is a separate
# variable over the same grid. The data are synthetic, so the notebook needs no
# download and every number in it can be checked against the truth.

# on. Inputs can be coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) or other data variables
# (`elevation`), and the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ follow the order we list them in.
# Cells where the target or any input is NaN are dropped by default, and the
# returned `GridSpec` records which ones.

# over hundreds of metres in elevation, so we give the RBF kernel one lengthscale
# per input. A constant mean absorbs the ~285 K offset.

#
# ## Joint samples and regional averages
#
# The mean and variance describe each cell on its own. Many questions are about
# several cells together, such as the average temperature over the Alpine box
# $\mathcal{R}$. Its variance depends on the covariance between the cells,
#
# $$
# \operatorname{Var}\Big[\tfrac{1}{|\mathcal{R}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{R}} f_i\Big]

# $$ (eq-xarray-regional-variance)
#
# which the per-cell variances alone cannot give. Passing `num_samples` to
# `to_xarray` draws from the joint predictive distribution instead, and returns the
# draws with a leading `sample` dimension. Averaging each draw over the region gives
# samples of the regional mean.

# Treating the cells as independent understates the uncertainty in the regional
# average by roughly an order of magnitude, because neighbouring cells tend to be
# wrong in the same direction. Against the joint standard deviation the true
# regional mean is a plausible outcome; against the independent one it would look
# like a many-sigma surprise. Joint
# samples keep that correlation, which is why `to_xarray` refuses to draw samples
# from a distribution that only holds marginal variances (as returned by
# `posterior(test_inputs, covariance="diagonal")`).
