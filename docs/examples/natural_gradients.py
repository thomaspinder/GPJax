# # Natural Gradients
#
# Download this notebook: {nb-download}`natural_gradients.ipynb`
#
# This notebook is the prerequisite for two others: the
# [natural gradients](natgrads.py) notebook and the
# [dual sparse GP](dual_svgp.py) notebook. Between them those two cover the
# GPJax API — how to call `gpx.fit_natgrads`, how to choose a variational
# family, how the method behaves on real training runs — and they assume
# everything below already: the exponential-family geometry of
# $q(\mathbf{u})$, the identity that makes the natural gradient free to
# compute, the site/dual reparameterisation of that same geometry, and the
# guarantees and failure modes attached to both. Read this one first; the
# other two will not re-derive any of it.
#
# Variational inference in a sparse Gaussian process asks us to optimise a
# probability distribution $q(\mathbf{u})$, not a point in $\mathbb{R}^P$.
# Gradient descent does not know that: it moves the *storage coordinates* of
# $q$ — a mean vector and a Cholesky factor, or, as we will see, a pair of
# site parameters — as though they lived in flat Euclidean space, and so the
# step it takes depends on how we happened to write the distribution down.
# The natural gradient repairs this by measuring distance between
# distributions with the Fisher information metric, which makes the update
# invariant to the parameterisation. `gpjax.fit_natgrads` implements the
# recipe of {cite:t}`salimbeni2018`, alternating a natural-gradient step on
# $q$ with an ordinary gradient step, taken with any Optax optimiser, on the
# kernel hyperparameters. Every call it makes at the $q$-step is a call to
# the lower-level primitive `natural_gradient_step`, which is what every demo
# below calls directly, so that we can inspect one step at a time.
#
# The remarkable practical point, developed in the first half of this
# notebook, is that for a Gaussian variational family the natural gradient
# costs *no* Fisher matrix at all: the Fisher information turns out to be the
# Jacobian between two standard exponential-family coordinate systems, so the
# natural gradient with respect to one of them is the plain gradient with
# respect to the other. The second half turns the same geometry over and
# looks at it from a different storage convention — the *site*, or *dual*,
# parameterisation of {cite:t}`adam2021dual` — and asks what changes and what
# provably does not.
#
# The route is:
#
# 1. the exponential-family view of $q(\mathbf{u})$, its two canonical
#    coordinate systems, and the third one GPJax actually stores;
# 2. the Fisher information is the Jacobian between them, checked
#    numerically;
# 3. the mirror-descent reading of the step, and why $\gamma \le 1$ is
#    special;
# 4. conjugate models, where one step at $\gamma=1$ is the exact answer — a
#    single shared demo that reaches the same optimum through both the
#    moment/whitened storage and the site/dual storage;
# 5. the site, or dual, reparameterisation of the same $q$, its EP heritage,
#    and the two silent convention traps that wait in the source material;
# 6. the tied natural-gradient update in site coordinates, and why it never
#    needs to invert anything;
# 7. cone-safety in both storage conventions — a negative-definite cone for
#    the moments, a positive-semidefinite cone for the sites — with the
#    numerical checks that locate exactly where each guarantee ends;
# 8. the two hyperparameter objectives, `elbo` and `dual_elbo`, and precisely
#    what is proven about the gap between them, versus what is only
#    measured;
# 9. practical guidance spanning both storage conventions.
#
# If you have not met sparse variational GPs before, read the
# [stochastic sparse GP notebook](uncollapsed_vi.py) first — everything below
# assumes the SVGP evidence lower bound.

# ## The exponential-family view
#
# The variational distribution over the inducing outputs is
# $q(\mathbf{u}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{S})$ with $\mathbf{m}$ of
# shape $M\times 1$ and $\mathbf{S}$ of shape $M \times M$. Written as an
# exponential family,
#
# $$\log q(\mathbf{u};\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \log h(\mathbf{u}) + \boldsymbol{\theta}^\top \mathbf{t}(\mathbf{u}) - A(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \qquad h(\mathbf{u}) = (2\pi)^{-M/2},$$
#
# with sufficient statistics
# $\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{u}) = [\,\mathbf{u},\ \operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^\top)\,]$.
# Matching terms gives the **natural parameters**
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\theta}_1 = \mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{m}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\Theta}_2 = -\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{S}^{-1} \prec 0,$$
#
# so that
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\top\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{u}^\top\boldsymbol{\theta}_1 + \mathbf{u}^\top\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2\mathbf{u}$.
# The **expectation parameters** are the mean of the sufficient statistics,
# $\boldsymbol{\eta} = \mathbb{E}_q[\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{u})]$:
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\eta}_1 = \mathbf{m}, \qquad \mathbf{H}_2 = \mathbf{S} + \mathbf{m}\mathbf{m}^\top \succ 0 .$$
#
# The log normaliser is
#
# $$A(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = -\tfrac{1}{4}\boldsymbol{\theta}_1^\top\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{-1}\boldsymbol{\theta}_1 - \tfrac{1}{2}\log\lvert -2\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2\rvert = \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{m}^\top\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{m} + \tfrac{1}{2}\log\lvert\mathbf{S}\rvert,$$
#
# and differentiating it recovers the expectation parameters,
# $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}A(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \boldsymbol{\eta}$ —
# the standard duality between the two coordinate systems.
#
# There is a third coordinate system in play, the one GPJax actually
# *stores*: $\boldsymbol{\xi} = (\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{L})$ with
# $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{L}^\top$ and $\mathbf{L}$ lower triangular
# with a positive diagonal. That choice keeps $\mathbf{S}$ positive definite
# under any unconstrained optimiser, but it is a storage convention, not a
# geometry. `gpjax.natural_gradients` exposes the four maps that connect the
# three systems — `expectation_from_moments`, `natural_from_moments`,
# `moments_from_expectation` and `moments_from_natural` — each built from
# Cholesky factors and triangular solves, with no explicit matrix inverse
# anywhere. Later in this notebook a fourth system joins them: the *site*, or
# *dual*, coordinates that `DualVariationalGaussian` stores instead of
# $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{L})$.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Fisher information is the Jacobian $\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}/\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}$
#
# Differentiating $\log q$ twice with respect to $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ kills
# the sufficient statistics and leaves only the log normaliser, so
#
# $$\mathbf{F}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} := -\mathbb{E}_q\!\left[\nabla^2_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\log q\right] = \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \nabla^2_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}A(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \operatorname{Cov}_q\!\left[\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{u})\right].$$
#
# The Fisher information of an exponential family is simultaneously the
# Hessian of its log normaliser, the Jacobian from natural to expectation
# parameters, and the covariance of its sufficient statistics. The middle
# equality is the one that pays. Let $\ell$ be a loss (for us, the negative
# ELBO). The chain rule in row-gradient form reads
# $\partial\ell/\partial\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\partial\ell/\partial\boldsymbol{\eta})(\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}/\partial\boldsymbol{\theta})$;
# transposing to column gradients and using the self-adjointness of
# $\mathbf{F} = \mathrm{D}\boldsymbol{\eta}$ (it is a Hessian) gives
# $(\partial\ell/\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{F}(\partial\ell/\partial\boldsymbol{\eta})$,
# so that
#
# $$\tilde\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\ell := \mathbf{F}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{-1}\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}} .$$
#
# **The gradient with respect to the expectation parameters is the natural
# gradient with respect to the natural parameters.** No Fisher matrix is
# built, and no linear system is solved. The update is
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\theta} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta} - \gamma\,\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}},$$
#
# with $\gamma$ the step size, called `natgrad_lr` in GPJax.
#
# One technical caveat before we check this numerically. The statistic
# $\operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^\top)$ has $M^2$ entries, but $q$
# depends on $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2$ only through its symmetric part, so in
# those redundant coordinates $\mathbf{F}$ is singular and $\mathbf{F}^{-1}$
# is not defined. The fix is to work on the space of symmetric matrices with
# the trace inner product
# $\langle \mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\rangle = \operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})$;
# concretely, flatten a symmetric matrix by stacking its lower triangle with
# the strictly off-diagonal entries scaled by $\sqrt{2}$. In those
# coordinates the Euclidean gradient is the correct gradient and $\mathbf{F}$
# is symmetric positive definite. The production step never forms
# $\mathbf{F}$ and so never needs any of this; we need it only to *verify*
# the identity, on a small non-conjugate model (Bernoulli likelihood,
# $M=3$).

# ## Mirror descent
#
# There is a second reading of the same update that explains the role of the
# step size. Let $\Psi = A^*$ be the convex conjugate of the log
# normaliser — the negative entropy of $q$ — so that
# $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \nabla\Psi(\boldsymbol{\eta})$. Mirror ascent on the
# ELBO $\mathcal{L}$ with mirror map $\Psi$ is
#
# $$\nabla\Psi(\boldsymbol{\eta}_{t+1}) = \nabla\Psi(\boldsymbol{\eta}_t) + \gamma\,\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}}, \qquad\text{i.e.}\qquad \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_t + \gamma\,\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}},$$
#
# which is precisely the natural-gradient step. The mirror-descent view is
# the reason $\gamma \le 1$ is not an arbitrary convention: as the next
# section shows concretely, the step is then a *convex combination* in
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-space between where $q$ is and where the current
# data want it to be. Going beyond $\gamma = 1$ is an extrapolation, and
# extrapolation is what breaks — a fact this notebook returns to twice, once
# for each storage convention, in the cone-safety section below.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conjugate models: one step is enough
#
# Suppose the ELBO can be written, for some fixed $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ that
# does not depend on $q$,
#
# $$\mathcal{L}(q) = \langle\boldsymbol{\lambda},\boldsymbol{\eta}\rangle + \mathbb{H}[q] + c,$$
#
# that is, $\mathbb{E}_q[\log p(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{u})]$ is affine in
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}$. This is exactly the conditionally-conjugate case: a
# Gaussian likelihood. Since
# $\mathbb{H}[q] = -\mathbb{E}_q[\log h] - \boldsymbol{\theta}^\top\boldsymbol{\eta} + A(\boldsymbol{\theta})$
# and $\partial A/\partial\boldsymbol{\theta} = \boldsymbol{\eta}$, the two
# Jacobian terms cancel and
# $\partial\mathbb{H}/\partial\boldsymbol{\eta} = -\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
# Therefore
#
# $$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}} = \boldsymbol{\lambda} - \boldsymbol{\theta} \qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{new}} = (1-\gamma)\,\boldsymbol{\theta} + \gamma\,\boldsymbol{\lambda},$$
#
# and $\gamma = 1$ gives
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol{\lambda} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star$
# **in one step, from any starting point**. This is Sato's (2001)
# observation that natural-gradient ascent at unit step size *is* the
# classical variational fixed-point update; for the SVGP it recovers the
# {cite:t}`titsias2009` optimum. Nothing in that argument refers to how $q$
# is stored — it is a statement about the $(\boldsymbol{\theta},
# \boldsymbol{\eta})$ geometry itself — so it has to hold equally for
# whatever storage convention we hand the step. We check that directly, on
# one shared problem, with two storage conventions at once. The second of
# them, `DualVariationalGaussian`, is not yet defined — that is the subject
# of the rest of this notebook — but it needs nothing more here than to be
# treated as a black box that also implements `natural_gradient_step`.
#
# The problem is a 1D conjugate regression, with a deliberately non-zero
# mean function so that neither branch gets a free pass on that front.

# The rest of this notebook is about the second branch: what it stores,
# where the update in that section came from, and exactly when — not if,
# *when* — the two branches stop being the same iteration.
#
# **One notational break, from here on.** Above, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ was
# the natural parameter of $q(\mathbf{u})$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ was the
# expectation parameter. From here $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is reserved for the
# kernel hyperparameters, which enter for the first time in the
# hyperparameter-learning section near the end. The natural parameter of
# $q(\mathbf{u})$ becomes $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, the expectation parameter
# becomes $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, and $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ is the *site* —
# not the fixed conjugate-likelihood vector of the derivation just above,
# which will not be needed again. In these letters the Fisher identity reads
# $\tilde\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\mathcal{L} = \partial\mathcal{L}/\partial\boldsymbol{\mu}$,
# and it is restated that way below.

# %% [markdown]
# ## From natural to dual coordinates
#
# Write the natural parameter of $q(\mathbf{u}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{S})$
# as $\boldsymbol{\eta} = (\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{m},\ -\tfrac12\mathbf{S}^{-1})$, and
# the natural parameter of the prior
# $p(\mathbf{u}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{K}_{zz})$ as
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = (\mathbf{0},\ -\tfrac12\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1})$.
# Their difference is the object this half of the notebook stores:
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\eta} = \underbrace{\left(\mathbf{0},\ -\tfrac12\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}\right)}_{\boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta})\ \text{prior}} \;+\; \underbrace{\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1,\ -\tfrac12\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\right)}_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}\ \text{sites}} .$$
#
# The decomposition is additive, and — in this convention — the second half
# carries no dependence on the kernel hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
# at all. Equivalently, $q$ is the prior reweighted by an unnormalised
# Gaussian *site*,
#
# $$t(\tilde{\mathbf{u}}) = \exp\!\left(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1^\top\tilde{\mathbf{u}} - \tfrac12\tilde{\mathbf{u}}^\top\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right), \qquad q(\mathbf{u}) \propto p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{u})\,t(\tilde{\mathbf{u}}),$$
#
# from which the moments follow by completing the square,
#
# $$\mathbf{S} = \left(\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1} + \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\right)^{-1}, \qquad \tilde{\mathbf{m}} = \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1, \qquad \mathbf{m} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_z + \tilde{\mathbf{m}} .$$
#
# Here $\tilde{\mathbf{u}} = \mathbf{u} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_z$ are the
# inducing outputs centred on the prior mean function — exactly the
# $\boldsymbol{\mu}_z$ that made the shared demo above need a non-zero mean
# function to be a fair test. `DualVariationalGaussian` stores
# $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1$ as `dual_vector` ($M\times1$) and
# $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$ as `dual_matrix` ($M\times M$), both defaulting to
# zero, which sets $q=p$ and makes the KL vanish at initialisation.
#
# Nothing here is ever inverted. Every quantity the family needs routes
# through
#
# $$\mathbf{R} := \mathbf{K}_{zz} + \mathbf{K}_{zz}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\mathbf{K}_{zz} = \mathbf{K}_{zz}\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{K}_{zz},$$
#
# which satisfies $\mathbf{R} \succeq \mathbf{K}_{zz} \succ 0$ whenever
# $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 \succeq 0$. So $\operatorname{chol}(\mathbf{R})$
# cannot fail, and it is *better* conditioned than
# $\operatorname{chol}(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2)$ would be, which is rank
# deficient at initialisation and whenever the batch is smaller than $M$.
# Two Cholesky factorisations per iteration, $\mathbf{L}_K$ and
# $\mathbf{L}_R$, and no more.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The EP connection
#
# Where do $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$ come from?
# {cite:t}`adam2021dual` show that the ELBO-optimal $q$ has the site form
#
# $$q^*(\mathbf{u}) \;\propto\; p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{u})\prod_{i=1}^{N} t_i^*(\mathbf{u}), \qquad t_i^*(\mathbf{u}) = \exp\!\left(\langle\boldsymbol{\lambda}_i^*,\ \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{u})\rangle\right),$$
#
# with $\mathbf{T}(v) = (v, v^2)$ the Gaussian sufficient statistics and
# $\mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}\mathbf{k}_z(x_i)$. Each $t_i$ is a
# **two-dimensional** object acting on the scalar projection
# $\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{u}$: one local likelihood approximation per data
# point, exactly as in expectation propagation. The difference from EP is
# where the site values come from. EP computes them by matching moments
# against a cavity distribution; here they are read straight off the first
# two derivatives of the expected log likelihood. With
# $q(f_i) = \mathcal{N}(m_i, v_i)$, Bonnet's and Price's theorems give
#
# $$\alpha_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial m_i}\,\mathbb{E}_{q(f_i)}\!\left[\log p(y_i\mid f_i)\right], \qquad \beta_i = -2\,\frac{\partial}{\partial v_i}\,\mathbb{E}_{q(f_i)}\!\left[\log p(y_i\mid f_i)\right],$$
#
# so a single `jax.grad` of the likelihood's existing
# `expected_log_likelihood` suffices. No second derivatives, and it works
# for closed-form and quadrature likelihoods alike. For a Gaussian
# likelihood $\alpha_i = (y_i - m_i)/\sigma^2$ and $\beta_i = 1/\sigma^2$;
# here are both, by autodiff.

# Both match the closed form to $10^{-14}$. Stored naively that is
# $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which would be a poor trade. But every $t_i$
# enters $q(\mathbf{u})$ only through the rank-one projection
# $\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{u}$, so the $N$ sites can be **tied**: summed
# into two inducing-space objects of size $M$ and $M\times M$. Writing
# $g_{1,i} = \alpha_i + \beta_i\,(m_i - \mu(x_i))$ and $g_{2,i} = \beta_i$,
# the tied values at a converged full-batch E-step are

# $$\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{a}_i g_{1,i} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{g}_1, \qquad \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}g_{2,i}\,\mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{a}_i^\top = \mathbf{A}\operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{g}_2)\mathbf{A}^\top .$$
#
# Memory is back to $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$, the same as standard SVGP. Two
# warnings. The tying introduces a bias — the paper says so, and reports
# that it "does not seem to affect convergence in practice." And these sums
# are the *fixed point*, not the value at a general iterate: during training
# the stored pair is a running convex combination of such targets, and is
# never computed by evaluating the sum.

# ## Two silent convention traps
#
# Two traps wait for anyone reading the paper alongside the code, and both
# are silent: each produces a valid-looking $q$ that is simply not the one
# intended.
#
# **The flanking trap.** The paper's main text stores the *un-flanked* sums,
# built from $\mathbf{k}_z(x_i)$ rather than
# $\mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}\mathbf{k}_z(x_i)$:
# $\bar{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}_1 = \mathbf{K}_{zz}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1$,
# $\bar{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}_2 = \mathbf{K}_{zz}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\mathbf{K}_{zz}$.
# Both conventions describe the same $q$ and give the same $\mathbf{R}$, but
# they are not interchangeable for our purposes: the additive,
# hyperparameter-free split of the previous section holds *exactly* only in
# the flanked convention, since in the un-flanked one
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}_1 = \mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}\bar{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}_1$
# moves with $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ too. The paper flags the choice in a
# single sentence and calls the flanked form "an alternative tying method";
# GPJax stores the alternative.
#
# **The $-\tfrac12$ trap.** The paper uses $\lambda_2$ with two incompatible
# meanings across its own equations: a natural-parameter one
# ($-\tfrac12\beta_i$) and a precision one ($g_{2,i} = \beta_i$). The dense
# limit settles it — with $\mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{X}$,
# $\mathbf{S}^{-1} = \mathbf{K}_{ff}^{-1} + \operatorname{diag}(\boldsymbol{\beta})$
# forces $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 = \operatorname{diag}(\boldsymbol{\beta})$,
# positive. **GPJax stores $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$ in the precision
# convention**: positive semi-definite, no $-\tfrac12$.
#
# The flanked convention is not free: storing $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$
# rather than $\bar{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}_2$ means a round trip through
# $\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}$ and back, which squares its condition number. That
# is dramatic entrywise, invisible in everything anyone actually reads off
# the model, and cheap to measure. Put the inducing inputs on the data
# themselves, $\mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{X}$, for the first forty points of the
# conjugate regression above — the worst case for
# $\operatorname{cond}(\mathbf{K}_{zz})$, and the one configuration in
# which the optimal sites are known on paper:
# $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1 = (\mathbf{y}-\boldsymbol{\mu}_x)/\sigma^2$ and
# $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 = \mathbf{I}/\sigma^2$. One $\rho=1$ step lands
# on that fixed point, exactly as in the shared demo, and what the family
# then *stores* can be compared entrywise against the paper answer.

# ## The tied natural-gradient update
#
# Now the payoff. Split the ELBO into its two terms, with $\boldsymbol{\mu}$
# the expectation parameter of $q$:
#
# $$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\eta}) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}}(\boldsymbol{\eta}) - \operatorname{KL}\left[q_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\,\|\,p_{\boldsymbol{\eta}_0}\right], \qquad \mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}} = \frac{N}{B}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{B}}\mathbb{E}_{q(f_i)}\!\left[\log p(y_i\mid f_i)\right].$$
#
# For an exponential family the KL between two of its members is
# $\langle\boldsymbol{\eta}-\boldsymbol{\eta}_0,\boldsymbol{\mu}\rangle - A(\boldsymbol{\eta}) + A(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0)$,
# and $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}A = \boldsymbol{\mu}$, so the two Jacobian
# terms cancel and
#
# $$\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\operatorname{KL}\left[q_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\,\|\,p_{\boldsymbol{\eta}_0}\right] = \boldsymbol{\eta} - \boldsymbol{\eta}_0 = \boldsymbol{\lambda} .$$
#
# **The KL's gradient is the stored parameter itself.** Since the natural
# gradient in $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ is the ordinary gradient in
# $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ — the Fisher identity from the first half of this
# notebook, restated in the new letters — the ascent step
# $\boldsymbol{\eta} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\eta} + \rho\,\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}$
# collapses to
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\lambda} \;\leftarrow\; (1-\rho)\,\boldsymbol{\lambda} \;+\; \rho\,\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}},$$
#
# a convex combination between where the sites are and where this
# mini-batch wants them. The KL never has to be differentiated at all.
# Chaining $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}}$ through the
# marginals and converting out of the $-\tfrac12$ convention gives the
# update in stored coordinates,
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1 \leftarrow (1-\rho)\boldsymbol{\lambda}_1 + \rho\,\frac{N}{B}\,\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{B}}\mathbf{g}_1^{\mathcal{B}}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 \leftarrow (1-\rho)\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 + \rho\,\frac{N}{B}\,\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{B}}\operatorname{diag}\!\left(\mathbf{g}_2^{\mathcal{B}}\right)\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{B}}^\top .$$
#
# The $N/B$ factor is not in the paper's printed update; without it the
# sites converge to $B/N$ of their correct value, since a mini-batch sum is
# $B/N$ of the full sum in expectation. GPJax supplies it.
#
# Two consequences worth stating separately. First, the update is
# **affine in the stored parameters**, so for $\rho\in[0,1]$ and
# $\beta_i\ge0$ it can never leave the positive semi-definite cone: a convex
# combination of PSD matrices is PSD. Second, $\rho$ **is** the Salimbeni
# step size $\gamma$ from the first half of this notebook, not a separate
# damping coefficient — the display above is
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}\leftarrow\boldsymbol{\eta}+\rho\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}$
# written out. GPJax accordingly uses one keyword, `natgrad_lr`, for both
# dispatch branches; the shared conjugate demo two sections back already
# used `1.0` for both. The cone-safety section below checks the two
# branches against each other step by step at $\rho=\gamma=0.8$.
#
# It is worth being concrete about what the site step does *not* do. A
# natural-gradient step in the moment parameterisation $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{L})$
# has to convert to $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, differentiate the whole ELBO —
# Cholesky of $\mathbf{K}_{zz}$, the conditional, and the KL — apply a
# Jacobian, and then convert back through $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, which costs
# an inverse and a fresh Cholesky. In site coordinates none of that happens,
# for two structural reasons: the stored coordinates *are* an affine image
# of $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, so the step is an affine step on them directly;
# and the target $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}}$ has a
# closed form whose only dependence on $q$ is through the marginals
# $(m_i, v_i)$, which the ELBO computes anyway.
#
# | stage | site (dual) | natural gradients on $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{L})$ |
# |---|---|---|
# | $\operatorname{chol}(\mathbf{K}_{zz})$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ |
# | $\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{B}} = \mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}\mathbf{K}_{zb}$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^2B)$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^2B)$ |

# | marginals $(m_i, v_i)$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^2B)$ | $\mathcal{O}(M^2B)$ |
# | $(\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\beta})$ | one `jax.grad` of a scalar in two $B$-vectors | the same, but inside the full AD tape |
# | gradient assembly | two `einsum`s, $\mathcal{O}(M^2B)$ | reverse-mode AD through chol / conditional / **KL**, plus a Jacobian |

# Same asymptotics, with strictly less work on the site side of the table.
# Whether that turns into wall-clock depends on how large a share of the
# iteration the saved work was; the [dual sparse GP notebook](dual_svgp.py)
# measures it on a real training run. What is certain is the direction of any difference: since
# the iterates are the same either way (subject to the cone-safety condition

# ## Cone-safety
#
# The step is
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}\leftarrow\boldsymbol{\theta} - \gamma\,\partial\ell/\partial\boldsymbol{\eta}$
# (moment coordinates) or
# $\boldsymbol{\lambda} \leftarrow (1-\rho)\boldsymbol{\lambda} + \rho\,\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ell}}$
# (site coordinates), and each has a cone it must not leave:
# $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2 \prec 0$ because it is $-\tfrac12$ a covariance
# inverse, and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2 \succeq 0$ because it is a precision.
# Nothing in either update enforces that automatically. We take the two
# cones in turn.
#
# **Moment coordinates: the negative-definite cone.** Splitting the ELBO as
# $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}} - \operatorname{KL}[q\,\|\,p]$ and
# using
# $\partial\operatorname{KL}/\partial\mathbf{S} = \tfrac12\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1} - \tfrac12\mathbf{S}^{-1}$
# gives an exact description of the step:
#
# $$\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{new}} = (1-\gamma)\,\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2 + \gamma\,\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{tgt}}, \qquad \boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{tgt}} := \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}}{\partial\mathbf{S}} - \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}$$
#
# (for the whitened family, replace $\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}$ by
# $\mathbf{I}_M$). So the step is a convex combination in
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-space whenever $\gamma\in[0,1]$ — the mirror-descent
# reading, made concrete.
#
# **Cone-safety theorem (moments).** If the likelihood is log-concave in
# $f$, then by Price's theorem
# ($\partial_{\mathbf{S}}\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{S})}[g] = \tfrac12\mathbb{E}[\nabla^2 g]$),
#
# $$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}}{\partial\mathbf{S}} = \frac{N}{B}\sum_{n\in\mathcal{B}}\tfrac{1}{2}\,\mathbb{E}_{q(f_n)}\!\left[\frac{\partial^2\log p(y_n\mid f_n)}{\partial f_n^2}\right]\mathbf{a}_n\mathbf{a}_n^\top \preceq 0,$$
#
# where $\mathbf{a}_n^\top$ is row $n$ of $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{K}_{xz}\mathbf{K}_{zz}^{-1}$.
# Hence $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{tgt}} \prec 0$, and for
# $\gamma\in[0,1]$ $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{new}}$ is a convex
# combination of two negative-definite matrices, so it is negative
# definite. **Mini-batching does not break this**, because $N/B>0$
# preserves the sign. $\square$
#
# Two things escape the theorem: $\gamma>1$, which extrapolates past
# $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{tgt}}$; and likelihoods that are not
# log-concave *as computed* — GPJax's `inv_probit` clips its output into
# $[10^{-3},1-10^{-3}]$, which flattens $\log p$ enough to give it a
# positive second derivative for $f\lesssim-2.44$, so even the Bernoulli
# model below leaves the guaranteed regime once a point is confidently
# mislabelled. We sweep $\gamma$ from an over-confident starting point,
# $\mathbf{S}_0=10^{-2}\mathbf{I}$, sharper than the target — precisely the
# regime where extrapolation bites — on the two-dimensional "banana"
# classification problem used again below.

# %% [markdown]
# Read that as a statement about *this initialisation*, not about
# $\gamma=2$ in general. Here $\mathbf{S}_0=10^{-2}\mathbf{I}$ makes
# $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2=-50\mathbf{I}$, an order of magnitude sharper than
# the target, so the convex combination has little room to extrapolate
# into: the sign flips between $\gamma=1$ ($-4.67$) and $\gamma=2$
# ($+40.66$), and linear interpolation puts the crossing at
# $\gamma\approx1.10$. What the theorem actually guarantees is
# $\gamma\in[0,1]$, for any log-concave likelihood and any starting point,
# and nothing whatsoever beyond that.
#
# When it does go wrong, `jnp.linalg.cholesky` returns `NaN` rather than
# raising, which means validity is a *value* and the fix stays
# `jit`-compatible: `natural_gradient_step` evaluates the trial steps
# $\{\gamma\beta^k\}_{k=0}^{K}$ under `vmap` and selects the first one whose
# Cholesky is finite. `backoff` ($\beta$, default $0.5$) and `max_backoff`
# ($K$, default $5$) are exposed by `fit_natgrads`. This backoff is specific
# to the moment branch — the site branch's affine update needs no such
# rescue, for the reason the rest of this section develops.
#
# **Site coordinates: the positive-semidefinite cone.** The tied update
# derived above is affine in $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$, so for
# $\rho\in[0,1]$ a convex combination of $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2\succeq0$
# and a PSD target stays PSD automatically — no Cholesky-validity check is
# needed, because there is nothing to fail. The one place this can still go
# wrong is upstream of the convex combination: the target itself is built
# from Price's curvature $\beta_i$, and $\beta_i\ge0$ needs the same
# log-concavity condition as the moment branch's cone-safety theorem — as
# *computed*, not as written. GPJax's dual step guards this with a floor,
# `beta_floor` (default $10^{-8}$), clipping $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ from below
# before it enters $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$. It is $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ that
# is clipped, never $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$ itself, so the update stays
# affine and `jit`/`scan`-safe.
#
# Since $\rho=\gamma$, the two branches should step *identically* — the same
# $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{S})$ at every iteration — for as long as the computed
# $\beta_i$ stay non-negative, and only then. We check this directly: six
# matched $\rho=\gamma=0.8$ steps on the banana problem, both branches
# started at $q=p$, comparing $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{S})$ after every step and
# recording Price's curvature just before it.

# For the first four steps every $\beta_i$ is positive, the clip does
# nothing, and the two branches agree to $\sim10^{-13}$ — the float64 noise
# floor. At step five a single training point out of 1600 crosses into
# $\beta_i<0$ — a label-$0$ point, whose log-likelihood is the
# $f\mapsto-f$ mirror of the $y=1$ case, so the $-2.44$ threshold derived
# above sits at $+2.44$ for it, and its marginal mean has just reached
# $+2.427$ — the `beta_floor` clip engages, and from
# that step the gap jumps to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and compounds at step
# six. Disabling the clip (`beta_floor=-jnp.inf`, the second line above)
# brings the same six steps back to the noise floor — $8.9\times10^{-13}$
# — which pins the cause down precisely: it is neither conditioning nor the
# cancellation in $\mathbf{H}_2=\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{m}\mathbf{m}^\top$ that
# the moment branch has to undo, since disabling the one thing that differs
# between the branches removes the discrepancy entirely. The condition the
# $\rho=\gamma$ identity needs — $\beta_i\ge0$, log-concavity as computed —
# is real, and this is exactly where and how it fails, on the same problem
# and the same clip that guarantees the site branch never leaves its own
# cone. The residual is still far below anything visible in the ELBO,
# which is the number either optimiser is steering by.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The M-step objective: `dual_elbo` versus `elbo`
#
# Variational EM alternates an E-step, which maximises the ELBO over $q$ at
# fixed $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, with an M-step, which maximises it over
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ at fixed $q$. "Fixed $q$" is the ambiguous part. In
# natural coordinates the E-step returns
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}^*_t = \boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) + \boldsymbol{\lambda}^*_t$,
# and there are two ways to hold that still:
#
# $$\text{standard:}\quad l(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{L}\big(\underbrace{\boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) + \boldsymbol{\lambda}^*_t}_{\text{all frozen}},\ \boldsymbol{\theta}\big), \qquad\qquad \text{dual:}\quad \bar l(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{L}\big(\boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \boldsymbol{\lambda}^*_t,\ \boldsymbol{\theta}\big).$$
#
# `elbo` computes the first, because a `VariationalGaussian` stores
# $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{L})$ and those are what stay fixed. `dual_elbo`
# computes the second, because a `DualVariationalGaussian` stores the
# sites, and the prior half of $q$ is rebuilt from
# $\mathbf{K}_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ every time the bound is evaluated.
# The intuition is that the sites encode what the *data* said, which is a
# property of the likelihood and should not be re-derived when the kernel
# moves, whereas the prior contribution to $q$ *should* move with the
# kernel. That is also why nothing derived from $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ may be
# cached on the family — caching $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{S})$ would turn
# `dual_elbo` back into `elbo` under differentiation while leaving every
# printed value identical, a silent bug of the worst kind.
#
# Here is what is actually guaranteed, which is less than the headline
# suggests:
#
# | claim | status |
# |---|---|
# | $\bar l$ is a valid lower bound on $\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{y})$ everywhere | **proven** — it is the ELBO at a legitimate Gaussian $q$ |
# | $\bar l(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) = l(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ | **proven**, exactly, at a converged E-step |
# | $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\bar l(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) = \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}l(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ | **proven**, same condition, by the envelope theorem |
# | $\bar l(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \ge l(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for *all* $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ | proven only when the sites are genuinely $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-free — a conjugate likelihood with its exact sites *and* $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X}$ |
# | $\bar l$ is a local upper bound on $l$ | proven in the conjugate case; the paper writes "we can't show this in the non-conjugate setting" |
# | faster EM convergence when non-conjugate | **empirical only** — "exact theoretical reasons behind the speed-ups are currently unknown to us" |
#
# The first row is free: any Gaussian $q$, whatever produced it, gives a
# valid ELBO. The second and third rows are the envelope theorem doing real
# work — at a stationary $q$ the *implicit* dependence of
# $\boldsymbol{\eta}_0(\boldsymbol{\theta})$'s contribution on
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ contributes nothing to the total derivative, so it
# does not matter whether the prior half of $q$ is allowed to move with
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ or not; away from stationarity it matters a great
# deal, since nobody runs an E-step to convergence between Adam steps in
# practice. The fourth and fifth rows need the sites to carry no implicit
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-dependence, which is only exactly true without
# sparsity: with $\mathbf{Z}\neq\mathbf{X}$ the flanked sites still route
# through $\mathbf{K}_{zx}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, so freezing them at
# $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ can make $\bar l$ sub-optimal, and in fact
# non-dominant, elsewhere. The sixth row is honestly labelled: the paper
# measures a speed-up and does not derive one.
#
# The claim we *can* check directly here is rows two and three: value and
# gradient equality, and how quickly they set in as the E-step converges.
# Two matched families — sites and moments, started at the same $q$ — take
# an increasing number of $\rho=\gamma=0.8$ E-steps before we read off the
# hyperparameter gradient of each bound.

# that matters: at zero E-steps the two hyperparameter gradients disagree by
# as much as their own magnitude ($39.0$ against a norm of $39.5$), and as
# the E-step is allowed to run longer the disagreement collapses
# geometrically — $0.80$, then $0.048$, then $9.1\times10^{-4}$, down to
# $2.9\times10^{-14}$ by 60 steps — exactly the envelope-theorem prediction
# that the two gradients coincide once, and only once, $q$ has actually
# stationarised. Away from that limit they are not close: they are
# different vectors, of comparable size, pointing the M-step in different
# directions. This is the fourth-row caveat made concrete on a specific
# model, not a claim that one direction is better; the
# [dual sparse GP notebook](dual_svgp.py) runs a full variational-EM loop
# on both objectives and checks which one actually gets further, which a

# ## Practical guidance
#
# Guidance that applies to **either** storage convention:
#
# * **Conjugate and full batch: use $\gamma=\rho=1$.** One iteration is the
#   exact solution — the shared demo above reached it from two different
#   starting points and two different storage conventions, both to
#   $\sim10^{-12}$ — and further iterations are fixed points.
# * **Never exceed a step size of $1$.** The convex-combination guarantee
#   stops there for both branches. On the moment side the backoff exists to
#   catch mistakes, not to enable them; on the site side there is no backoff
#   at all, because the update never needs rescuing within $[0,1]$.
# * **Non-log-concave likelihoods have no guarantee at all, on either
#   branch — as *computed*, not as written.** GPJax's `inv_probit` clips
#   its output, which flattens $\log p$ enough to break log-concavity past
#   $f\approx-2.44$; a Student-$t$ likelihood is not log-concave anywhere
#   near that mild. The moment branch's target can leave the
#   negative-definite cone; the site branch's computed $\beta_i$ can go
#   negative and rely on `beta_floor` to stay safe. Neither is a defect in
#   the optimiser — both are a property of the likelihood.
# * **The natural gradient buys optimiser speed, not a better $q$ at the
#   same $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.** Wherever the cone-safety condition holds,
#   the two branches are the *same iteration*; the only thing either
#   storage convention can change is how fast that iteration is computed,
#   and how the M-step behaves once $q$ moves. A more sharply peaked $q$
#   only appears if the underlying variational optimum actually is one.
#
# Guidance specific to **moment storage** ($(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{L})$, via
# `VariationalGaussian` or `WhitenedVariationalGaussian`):
#
# * **Non-conjugate or mini-batched: ramp $\gamma$.** Salimbeni et al.
#   recommend starting around $10^{-4}$ and reaching $\approx10^{-1}$
#   "sufficiently quickly ($<1000$ iterations)"; `natgrad_lr` accepts any
#   Optax schedule.
# * **Prefer the whitened family.** The natural-gradient direction is
#   parameterisation-invariant, so whitening does not change the sequence
#   of distributions in exact arithmetic; it changes the *conditioning* of
#   every map, and keeps $\mathbf{m}_w,\mathbf{S}_w$ at $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
# * **Leave `map_jitter` at $0$.** It biases $\mathbf{S}$ by
#   $\approx\varepsilon\lVert\mathbf{S}\rVert^2$ independently of
#   conditioning. Raise it only when fighting an ill-conditioned
#   $\mathbf{S}$.
# * **If a mini-batched run produces `NaN`, raise the batch size before
#   lowering $\gamma$.** Small batches make
#   $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_2^{\text{tgt}}$ badly conditioned, which no step
#   size fully repairs.
#
# Guidance specific to **site storage**
# (`DualVariationalGaussian`):
#
# * **One latent process.** Everything above assumes $L=1$. The site
#   structure across multiple latent GPs is block diagonal only when the
#   variational family is itself latent-diagonal, and the tied projection
#   would need to be re-derived for a multi-output model.
# * **Flanked storage squares $\operatorname{cond}(\mathbf{K}_{zz})$.**
#   Benign at the level of $\mathbf{R}$, the moments and the bound, and
#   visibly not benign entrywise in $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$. Never write a
#   test against $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_2$ directly.
# * **`beta_floor` is not a no-op for Bernoulli.** It is what breaks the
#   $\rho=\gamma$ identity once a point is confidently mislabelled, and it
#   is doing exactly its job when it does — keeping the update inside the
#   PSD cone rather than letting a negative $\beta_i$ push it out.
