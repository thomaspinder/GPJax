# # Orthogonal Additive Kernels
#
# Download this notebook: {nb-download}`oak.ipynb`
#
# In this notebook we demonstrate the Orthogonal Additive Kernel (OAK) of
# {cite:t}`lu2022additive`.
# OAK provides an interpretable additive Gaussian process model that decomposes
# the target function into main effects and interaction terms, whilst remaining
# a valid positive-definite kernel. The key ingredients are:
#
# 1. A per-dimension constrained SE kernel that is orthogonal to the
#    constant function under the input density.
# 2. Newton-Girard recursion to efficiently combine these constrained
#    kernels into elementary symmetric polynomials up to a chosen interaction
#    order.
# 3. Analytic Sobol indices that quantify the relative importance of each
#    interaction order, enabling practitioners to understand which features
#    and feature interactions drive the model's predictions.
#
# We illustrate the full workflow on the UCI Auto MPG dataset.

# ## Mathematical background
#
# ### Additive GP decomposition
#
# A standard GP with a single kernel $k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$ treats all
# input dimensions jointly, and the resulting fit tells you little about which
# dimension did what.  An additive GP instead decomposes
# the latent function as
#
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# f(\mathbf{x})
# & = f_0
# + \sum_{d=1}^{D} f_d(x_d) \\
# & \quad + \sum_{d < d'} f_{dd'}(x_d, x_{d'})
# + \cdots
# \end{aligned}
# $$ (eq-oak-additive-decomposition)
#
# where $f_0$ is a constant offset, $f_d$ are first-order (main) effects,
# $f_{dd'}$ are second-order interactions, and so on.  Truncating at a maximum
# interaction order $\tilde{D} \le D$ yields a model that scales gracefully
# whilst retaining interpretability.
#
# ### The identifiability problem
#
# A naive additive decomposition is unidentifiable: one can freely shift
# mass between the constant term and a main effect, or between a main effect
# and an interaction.  Lu et al. resolve this by requiring each component to
# be orthogonal to all lower-order components under the input density
# $p(\mathbf{x})$.  In particular, the first-order components satisfy
#
# $$
# \int f_d(x_d) \, p(x_d) \, \mathrm{d}x_d = 0 \quad \forall\, d.
# $$ (eq-oak-orthogonality-constraint)
#
# ### Constrained SE kernel
#
# Assuming a standard normal input density $p(x_d) = \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, the
# orthogonality constraint can be enforced analytically.  The constrained
# SE kernel is
#
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \tilde{k}(x, y)
# & = k(x, y) \\
# & \quad - \frac{\sigma^2 \ell \sqrt{\ell^2 + 2}}{\ell^2 + 1}
#   \exp\!\left(
#     -\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2(\ell^2 + 1)}
#   \right),
# \end{aligned}
# $$ (eq-oak-constrained-se-kernel)
#
# where $k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \exp\!\bigl(-\tfrac{(x-y)^2}{2\ell^2}\bigr)$ is
# the standard SE kernel with lengthscale $\ell$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
# The subtracted projection term removes the component of $k$ that lies along
# the constant function under the $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ measure.
#
# ### Newton-Girard recursion
#
# The additive kernel across all interaction orders up to $\tilde{D}$ is
#
# $$
# K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')
# = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\tilde{D}} \sigma_\ell^2 \, e_\ell\!\bigl(
#     \tilde{k}_1(x_1, x_1'),\, \ldots,\, \tilde{k}_D(x_D, x_D')
#   \bigr),
# $$ (eq-oak-additive-kernel)
#
# where $e_\ell$ denotes the $\ell$-th elementary symmetric polynomial
# and $\sigma_\ell^2$ are learnable order variances.  Computing
# $e_\ell$ directly via the combinatorial definition would be prohibitively
# expensive; instead GPJax uses the Newton-Girard identities which
# express $e_\ell$ recursively in terms of power sums
# $s_k = \sum_{d=1}^D z_d^k$:
#
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# e_\ell & = \frac{1}{\ell} \sum_{k=1}^{\ell} (-1)^{k-1}\, e_{\ell-k}\, s_k, \\
# e_0 & = 1.
# \end{aligned}
# $$ (eq-oak-newton-girard)
#
# ### Sobol indices
#
# Once the model is fitted, the relative importance of each interaction order
# can be quantified via Sobol indices.  The Sobol index for order $d$ is
#
# $$
# S_d
# = \frac{
#     \sigma_d^4 \;\boldsymbol{\alpha}^\top E_d \,\boldsymbol{\alpha}
#   }{
#     \sum_{d'=1}^{\tilde{D}}
#       \sigma_{d'}^4 \;\boldsymbol{\alpha}^\top E_{d'}\,\boldsymbol{\alpha}
#   },
# $$ (eq-oak-sobol-index)
#
# where $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (K + \sigma_n^2 I)^{-1}\mathbf{y}$ and $E_d$
# is the matrix-level elementary symmetric polynomial of the per-dimension
# integral matrices (see Appendix G.1 of the paper).

# ## Dataset
#
# We use the [UCI Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto-mpg)
# dataset, which contains fuel consumption data for 392 cars described by 7
# continuous features (cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight,
# acceleration, model year, and origin).
#
# Because the OAK kernel's constrained form assumes a standard normal input
# density ($\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 1$), we fit a per-feature normalising flow
# that maps each marginal to an approximately standard normal distribution.
# Targets are z-score standardised. This transformation of the inputs data
# is crucial for the OAK model to work correctly, as the orthogonality
# constraint is defined with respect to the input density.

# ### Normalising flow and train/test split
#
# The constrained SE kernel assumes $p(x_d) = \mathcal{N}(0,1)$.  Simple
# z-scoring removes the first two moments but cannot correct skewness or
# heavy tails.  We therefore fit a lightweight per-feature normalising flow
# (Shift → Log → Standardise → SinhArcsinh) that maps each marginal to an
# approximately standard normal distribution.

# ## Fitting an OAK GP
#
# We create $D$ independent [`RBF`](#gpjax.kernels.RBF) base kernels, one per
# input dimension, each
# operating on a single dimension via `active_dims=[i]` (the
# [kernel guide](constructing_new_kernels.py#active-dimensions) explains this
# argument).  These are wrapped inside
# [`OrthogonalAdditiveKernel`](../reference/kernels.md) with `max_order=D`
# (i.e. we allow all interaction orders).  The kernel is then used in a standard conjugate GP
# workflow: define a [`Prior`](#gpjax.gps.Prior) and
# [`Gaussian`](#gpjax.likelihoods.Gaussian) likelihood, form the posterior, and
# optimise hyperparameters by maximising the
# [marginal log-likelihood](#gpjax.objectives.conjugate_mll), exactly as
# in the [regression notebook](regression.py).

# $\tilde{k}_d(x_*, X_{\mathrm{train},d})$ between a 1-D grid and the
# training points, then form the conditional mean and variance in the usual
# GP way.
