"""Sphinx configuration for the GPJax documentation.

Single-engine build: MyST-NB parses and executes the example notebooks, Sphinx
renders everything. No MkDocs, no mkdocstrings, no markdown post-processing.

Ported from ../impulso/docs/conf.py. Deviations from that file are commented
inline and are limited to (a) names/URLs, (b) `bibtex_default_style`,
(c) `default_role`, (d) `exclude_patterns`.

# On the deploy path a broken notebook must not block the whole site, so the two

# False the number comes from `env.new_serialno('eqno')` instead, which the

# This affects equations only: section and toctree numbering come from
# `:numbered:` on a toctree, which this project does not use.
math_numfig = False
# `math_number_all` is deliberately NOT set. Two reasons, in order:
#
# 1. It would not work. Sphinx applies `math_number_all` inside the `math`
#    *directive* (sphinx.directives.patches.MathDirective), but MyST's dollarmath
#    builds `math_block` nodes itself and never goes through that directive, so
#    every `$$...$$` in the notebooks and .md pages would stay unnumbered. Only
#    `.. math::` / ```{math}``` blocks — i.e. the docstrings — would gain numbers.
# 2. Even if it did work it would number the ~40 display equations inside API
#    docstrings, which are definitions rather than referenceable statements.
#
# Prose display equations are therefore numbered by giving each one an explicit
# MyST label: `$$ ... $$ (eq-descriptive-label)`. That is required anyway for the
# `{eq}` cross-references, and it keeps numbering confined to the pages that want
# it. Labels are global to the project, so they carry a per-page prefix.

# -- Intersphinx -------------------------------------------------------------
# Each mapping lists two inventory locations: the upstream one (`None` means
# "<target_uri>objects.inv"), then a vendored copy under `_inventories/`.
# intersphinx tries them in order and stops at the first that loads.
#
# The fallback exists because this build runs under `-W`, and an unreachable
# inventory is a hard failure. It is not hypothetical: a CI run failed with
# `415 Unsupported Media Type` fetching the equinox inventory from a GitHub
# runner, while the same URL returned 200 from a laptop -- bot protection
# reacting to the runner, not a broken URL. The warning carries no warning type
# (sphinx/ext/intersphinx/_load.py:326), so `suppress_warnings` cannot single it
# out; the choice would otherwise be a flaky gate or no `-W` at all.
#
# The failure levels make this work: all locations failing logs a warning, but
# *some* failing while another succeeds logs only info (`_load.py:319-327`), so
# falling back to the vendored copy keeps the build green and silent under `-W`.
#
# Cost: the vendored inventories go stale, so a newly added upstream object will
# not resolve until they are refreshed -- only on builds where the fetch failed.
# Refresh by re-downloading each `objects.inv` into docs/_inventories/.

# -- Redirects from the retired MkDocs site (sphinx-reredirects) -------------
# The retired MkDocs site (then at docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com) ran with
# `use_directory_urls`
# (the default), so every old page lived at `<path>/`, i.e. the file
# `<path>/index.html`. The keys below therefore end in `/index`, which is what
# puts the emitted meta-refresh stub exactly where the old URL pointed.
#
# Targets are written site-absolute; sphinx-reredirects rewrites each one into
# the right number of `../` hops for the depth of its own key.
#
# Two families of URL moved:
#
# 1. API reference. `docs/scripts/gen_pages.py` walked
#    `sorted(Path("gpjax").rglob("*.py"))` and emitted one mkdocstrings page per
#    module at `/api/<module path>/`. There is no per-module page any more: the
#    reference is now hand-written per top-level package with autosummary stubs
#    underneath. Each old module page therefore points at the reference page for
#    its top-level package -- the most specific page that still exists -- rather
#    than at the reference index.
#
# 2. Tutorials. Notebooks moved from `/_examples/<name>/` to
#    `/examples/<name>.html`. Heading anchors survive the move
#    (`myst_heading_anchors = 3` reproduces the MkDocs slugs), and the stub
#    forwards `window.location.hash`, so deep links such as
