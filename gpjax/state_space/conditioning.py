r"""The conditioned process for state-space (Markovian) Gaussian processes.

:class:`~gpjax.conditioning.Posterior` is the one home of "a GP conditioned on
data" in GPJax, and this module supplies the state-space member of that family.
Where :class:`~gpjax.conditioning.ExactPosterior` factorises a dense
:math:`N \times N` covariance, a state-space model never forms one: every
conditioned quantity — the smoothed predictive, the filtered predictive, and
the evidence — is read off a square-root Kalman pass that costs
:math:`O(N d^3)` in time and :math:`O(N d^2)` in memory.

Because the Kalman recursions run on a *merged* train-plus-test grid, there is
no factorisation shared between queries to cache; conditioning is therefore a
cheap, eager bundling of the model with its training set, and each query runs
its own linear-time pass. The value of the object is interface uniformity, not
amortisation: ``model | D`` and ``model.condition(D)`` now reach the Kalman
path rather than silently falling back on the dense algebra the state-space
model exists to avoid.

See plans/2026-04-21-state-space-gps-design.md for the full design.

    Produced by :meth:`gpjax.state_space.gps.StateSpaceConjugateModel.condition`
    (equivalently ``model | train_data``). Calling it runs the square-root
    Kalman filter and RTS smoother over the merged train-plus-test time grid,
    so the predictive is the *smoothed* latent posterior. :meth:`filtered`
    gives the causal (filter-only) alternative, and
    :attr:`log_marginal_likelihood` gives the evidence from the same filter.

    Predictive contract (v1): every query returns diagonal (marginal)
    covariance only. The marginals are exact; a dense joint predictive is not
    implemented in v1. This predictive is therefore not Liskov-substitutable
    for a dense :class:`gpjax.conditioning.ExactPosterior` predictive, and
    ``covariance="dense"`` raises :class:`NotImplementedError`.

    Time ordering: the predictive queries merge and sort the train and test
    grids internally, so they are order-insensitive.
    :attr:`log_marginal_likelihood` is not — it inherits the time-sorted-input
    assumption of :func:`gpjax.state_space.objectives.state_space_mll`. Fitting
    through the ``gpjax.state_space.fit*`` wrappers sorts the data for you.

    Attributes:
        model: The :class:`StateSpaceConjugateModel` that was conditioned.
        train_data: The observations conditioned on.
        observation_mask: Optional boolean mask over the training points;
            ``False`` entries are not conditioned on. ``None`` conditions on
            every point.
