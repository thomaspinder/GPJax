## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`gpjax.fit_natgrads` and the `gpjax.natural_gradients` module.** Trains a variational
  family by alternating one natural-gradient step on the variational distribution with
  one step of a supplied Optax optimiser on everything else — kernel and likelihood
  hyperparameters, the mean function, and the inducing inputs — following Salimbeni,
  Eleftheriadis and Hensman (2018), [arXiv:1803.09151](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09151).
  `VariationalGaussian` and `WhitenedVariationalGaussian` are supported. For a conjugate
  model on the full batch, `natgrad_lr=1.0` reaches the optimal `q` in one iteration.

- **`DualVariationalGaussian` and `gpjax.objectives.dual_elbo`.** The dual (t-SVGP)
  parameterisation of Adam, Chang, Khan and Solin (2021),
  [arXiv:2111.03412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03412). Instead of the moments of
  `q(u)`, the family stores an unnormalised Gaussian *site* on the centred inducing
  outputs — `dual_vector` is the site's first natural parameter and `dual_matrix` its
  precision — from which `q(u)` is recovered through the working matrix
  `R = Kzz + Kzz Lambda_2 Kzz`. Because the stored coordinates are an affine image of
  the natural parameters, a natural-gradient step is a convex combination of the
  current sites with a closed-form target, so no expectation-to-natural round trip is
  needed and the KL is never differentiated. `fit_natgrads` dispatches on the family
  and takes that step; the step size means the same thing in both branches, and from
  the same starting `q` the dual and Salimbeni E-steps produce identical iterates —
  provided the dual branch's computed per-point curvature stays non-negative, so that
  its `beta_floor` never engages. That holds for a genuinely log-concave likelihood;
  GPJax's `inv_probit` clips its probabilities away from 0 and 1, which breaks
  log-concavity in the far tails, and there the two branches diverge. The
  dual branch restricts the step size to the interval from zero to one, since the
  update is a convex combination.
  `dual_elbo` has the same *value* as `elbo` at the implied moments, for any sites and
  any hyperparameters, but a different *hyperparameter gradient from `elbo` evaluated on
  the matched `VariationalGaussian`*: the prior part of `q` tracks the kernel while the
  data-dependent sites stay frozen. The difference is between the two
  parameterisations, not between the two functions — calling `elbo` directly on a
  `DualVariationalGaussian` returns the same value and the same gradients as
  `dual_elbo`, which is simply the batched-marginals fast path for that family. That
  frozen-site gradient is what gives the M-step its reported behaviour, so `Kzz` must
  not be detached and the implied moments must not be cached on the family.
  `DualVariationalGaussian` also works with plain `gpjax.fit`, where it is ordinary
  gradient descent in the dual coordinates. The `VariationalParametrisationSuite` ASV
  benchmark gains a `dual` axis value.

### Removed

- **`NaturalVariationalGaussian` and `ExpectationVariationalGaussian`.** These were
  parameterisation-only classes with no optimiser attached: they stored the natural or
  expectation coordinates of `q(u)` but offered no way to take a natural-gradient step
  in them. Natural-gradient geometry belongs to the optimiser — the Fisher matrix *is*
  the Jacobian dη/dθ, so a natural-gradient step in the natural parameters θ is exactly
  an ordinary gradient step in the expectation parameters η, and either coordinate system
  can be recovered on the fly from whatever the family happens to store. `fit_natgrads`
  therefore operates directly on `VariationalGaussian` and `WhitenedVariationalGaussian`,
  which store constraint-respecting coordinates. Users of the removed classes should
  switch to `VariationalGaussian` with `gpjax.fit_natgrads`.
  The `VariationalParametrisationSuite` ASV benchmark loses its `natural` and
  `expectation` axis values; previously recorded results for those two arms are orphaned.

### Fixed

- **`gpx.kernels.RBF()` was a type error, and `White()` carried a phantom
  trainable lengthscale**
  ([#695](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/695)). Pyright
  synthesises `__init__` signatures from dataclass fields for any kernel that
  inherits its `__init__` (e.g. `RBF`, `Matern12/32/52`), and those fields had
  no defaults, so the canonical `RBF()` call was flagged as missing arguments
  while the nonsensical `RBF(name="xyz")` type-checked cleanly (raising
  `TypeError` at runtime). Kernel fields now carry real defaults matching
  their `__init__` defaults, and `name` is a `ClassVar` rather than a
  dataclass field, so the synthesised and hand-written signatures agree.
  Separately, `White` hardcoded `lengthscale=1.0` into
  `StationaryKernel.__init__` even though `White.__call__` never reads it,
  so every `White` kernel carried a real, trainable `PositiveReal` leaf with
  zero gradient that showed up in optimiser state and MCMC traces; `White`
  now has its own minimal `__init__` and no longer carries a lengthscale at
  all (`White().lengthscale is None`, and it is absent from
  `jax.tree_util.tree_flatten`). The stale `_compute_base_init` workaround in
  `kernels/base.py`, whose docstring claimed "equinox modules are frozen
  after `super().__init__()`" -- no longer true under the pinned Equinox
  version -- was removed in favour of a plain `super().__init__(...)` call.

- **`Zero` mean function is trainable and drifts away from zero.** Fitting a
  model with the default `Zero()` mean function moved its constant towards the
  data mean (0.0 → 5.09 on a dataset with mean 5), silently changing the
  posterior mean of every such model
  ([#712](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/712)). This is a
  regression of [#330](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/330),
  fixed once in #500 and reintroduced by the Equinox migration. The cause is a
  changed trainability contract rather than a lost line: under `nnx`, `fit`
  optimised only `Parameter` instances, so `Zero`'s bare array was inert by
  construction; under Equinox, `fit` partitions on `eqx.is_array`, which makes
  every array leaf trainable. `Zero` now wraps its constant in
  `paramax.non_trainable`, so it stays at zero by construction. `Constant` is
  unchanged and remains trainable.

  `Zero().constant` is now a `NonTrainable` wrapper rather than a bare array.
  Read it with `paramax.unwrap(mean_function).constant` (or `_val`) if you were
  accessing it directly; evaluating the mean function is unaffected.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-26

### Removed

- **`tensorstore` runtime dependency** (macOS only). It was declared in
  `pyproject.toml` but imported nowhere in the package, forcing a ~14 MB wheel
  onto every macOS install
  ([#675](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/675)). Nothing
  else in the dependency graph requires it, so it was not a resolver workaround.
  A regression test now asserts every declared runtime dependency is actually
  imported.

### Fixed

- **`distributions._kl_divergence`**: now computes both log-determinants from the
  Cholesky factors it has already built, halving the O(N³) work on the hot path
  of every ELBO step. It previously factorised `Σq` and `Σp` for the trace and
  Mahalanobis terms, then called `logdet(Σq)` and `logdet(Σp)`, whose generic
  implementation factorised both covariances a *second* time — four
  factorisations where two suffice
  ([#664](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/664)). A new
  `linalg.logdet_from_factor(L)` helper computes `log|L Lᵀ| = 2 Σᵢ log Lᵢᵢ` and
  is itself `singledispatch`ed, so diagonal, block-diagonal, Kronecker and
  identity operators keep their structure-exploiting fast paths instead of being
  densified. Returned values are unchanged.
- **`prior_kl` for `VariationalGaussian` and `WhitenedVariationalGaussian`**: both
  now evaluate in closed form from the stored triangular root, instead of
  densifying `S = sqrt sqrtᵀ` and handing it to the generic Gaussian KL, which
  re-factorised a matrix whose Cholesky factor was already to hand
  ([#665](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/665)). The
  whitened KL against `N(0, I)` needs no factorisation at all and went from two
  dense Choleskys per call to zero; `VariationalGaussian` went from four to one,
  the unavoidable factorisation of `Kzz`. Values and gradients are unchanged.
  Every variational training step pays this cost, so `grad(prior_kl)` is roughly
  13× faster for the whitened family and 3× faster for `VariationalGaussian` at
  1024 inducing points. `GraphVariationalGaussian` and
  `HeteroscedasticVariationalFamily` inherit the improvement.
- **`HeteroscedasticGaussian.link_function`**: now requires the noise latent `g`
  and returns the conditional `N(y | f, σ²(g))`. It previously evaluated the
  noise transform at `g = 0` and returned the *prior-noise* density
  `N(y | f, σ²(0))` — silently, and independently of the noise process the
  likelihood exists to model
  ([#670](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/670)). Callers
  passing only `f` now get a `ValueError` pointing at the correct API instead of
  a wrong number.
- **`StationaryKernel.spectral_density`**: now returns the correctly
  parameterised spectral measure. It previously returned a *standardised*
  distribution (`Normal(0, 1)` for RBF, `StudentT(2ν, 0, 1)` for Matérn) that
  ignored the lengthscale and was hard-coded to one dimension, so
  `kernel.spectral_density.log_prob(ω)` gave the same curve for every ℓ
  ([#612](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax/issues/612)). The
  measure is now `D`-dimensional and carries `diag(ℓ)⁻¹` as its scale (ARD
  lengthscales included), satisfying Bochner's theorem
  `k(τ) = σ²·E_p(ω)[exp(i ωᵀτ)]`.

### Changed

- **`HeteroscedasticGaussian.link_function`** signature is now `(f, g=None)`. The
  `g` argument is mandatory in practice; omitting it raises rather than silently
  substituting `g = 0`. A heteroscedastic subclass that inherits
  `AbstractLikelihood.expected_log_likelihood` (which calls `link_function(f)`)
  now fails loudly instead of integrating against the prior-noise density.
  `HeteroscedasticGaussian` itself overrides that method, so the sanctioned
  variational path is unchanged.

- **`StationaryKernel.spectral_density`** return type is now
  `MultivariateNormal` / `MultivariateStudentT` with `event_shape == (D,)`,
  where it was previously the univariate `Normal` / `StudentT`. Code calling
  `.sample(key, (M, D))` should now call `.sample(key, (M,))`.
- **`kernels.approximations.RFF`** with an explicitly supplied `frequencies=`
  argument now treats those values as the spectral frequencies ω directly.
  They were previously divided by the lengthscale inside
  `BasisFunctionComputation.compute_features`, silently rescaling user-supplied
  frequencies. RFF Gram/cross-covariance values with *sampled* frequencies are
  bit-identical to `0.17.0` — the lengthscale simply moved from the feature map
  into the measure it is drawn from.

#### Migration

- **`StationaryKernel.spectral_density`**: the return type is now
  `MultivariateNormal` / `MultivariateStudentT` with `event_shape == (D,)`.
  Replace `kernel.spectral_density.sample(key, (M, D))` with
  `kernel.spectral_density.sample(key, (M,))`. Values from `log_prob` now vary
  with the lengthscale, as they always should have — there is no restore path,
  the previous output was incorrect.
- **`kernels.approximations.RFF(..., frequencies=...)`**: supplied frequencies
  are now used as the spectral frequencies ω directly. If you were
  pre-compensating for the old division by the lengthscale, remove that
  compensation. RFF with *sampled* frequencies is bit-identical to `0.17.0`.
- **`HeteroscedasticGaussian.link_function`**: now requires the noise latent,
  `link_function(f, g)`. Calls passing only `f` raise `ValueError`; they
  previously returned `N(y | f, σ²(0))`, which was wrong. Use
  `expected_log_likelihood(..., mean_g=, variance_g=)` or
  `predict(dist, noise_dist)` if you want the noise handled for you.
- **`tensorstore`**: removed as a runtime dependency. If you imported it
  transitively via GPJax on macOS, depend on it explicitly.
- **KL divergences**: `distributions._kl_divergence` and the variational
  `prior_kl` methods return the same values as `0.17.0` (bit-identical, or to
  ~1e-16 where floating-point reassociation applies). No action needed.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **`Prior.sample_approx` / `ConjugatePosterior.sample_approx`**: split the PRNG
  key before drawing RFF frequencies, Fourier weights, and (posterior) noise.
  They previously shared one key, making the pathwise-sample cross-covariance
  biased (Wilson et al. 2020 §3 requires independence). Marginals were
  unaffected.
- **`kernels.approximations.RFF`**: multi-dimensional Matérn frequencies are now
  drawn from a `MultivariateStudentT` (shared inverse-χ² per row), matching the
  isotropic Matérn spectral density. Previously iid-per-dim `StudentT` draws
  approximated a *tensor-product* Matérn in `d > 1`. `d == 1` is unchanged.
- **`objectives.conjugate_loocv`**: now routes noise and targets through the
  likelihood protocol, so multi-output (`MultiOutputGaussian`) LOOCV is correct
  (leave-one-scalar-out on the flattened NP system). Also removed a redundant
  `jnp.linalg.inv` (audit #662).
- **`kernels.nonstationary.ArcCosine`**: `weight_variance` and `bias_variance`
  are now wrapped in `NonNegativeReal`. They were previously assigned raw —
  silently frozen (Python-float default, excluded by `eqx.partition`) or
  trainable-but-unconstrained (array value, driveable negative → NaN).
- **`models.create_oilmm_from_data`**: now performs the documented PCA
  eigen-initialisation of the mixing matrix (top-M eigenvectors/eigenvalues of
  the empirical output covariance) instead of returning the random default. Raises
  `ValueError` for `N < 2` (empirical covariance is undefined).

### Changed

- Pathwise samples from `sample_approx` with a fixed `key` now differ from
  `0.16.0` (the old draws were biased — see Fixed above). No restore path; the
  old outputs were incorrect.
- Multi-dimensional Matérn `RFF` Gram matrices now converge to the isotropic
  Matérn. `d > 1` outputs differ from `0.16.0`. No restore path.
- Multi-output `conjugate_loocv` values differ from `0.16.0`. No restore path.
- **`models.OILMMPosterior.predict(..., return_full_cov=False)`** now returns a
  `lineax.DiagonalLinearOperator` scale (was a densified `MatrixLinearOperator`).
  Values are unchanged.
- **`Prior.predict` / `ConjugatePosterior.predict` / `NonConjugatePosterior.predict`
  with `return_covariance_type="diagonal"`** now return a
  `lineax.DiagonalLinearOperator` scale (was a densified `MatrixLinearOperator`).
  Values are unchanged; construction drops from O(M²) to O(M) memory and the
  `predict(...,"diagonal") → likelihood()` chain now uses the O(M) fast path.

#### Migration

- **ArcCosine**: if you relied on the accidental freeze of `weight_variance` /
  `bias_variance`, restore it explicitly with `paramax.non_trainable(...)`.
- **`sample_approx` / multi-dim Matérn RFF / multi-output LOOCV**: no restore
  path — the previous outputs were incorrect.
- **OILMM diagonal predict**: `predict(..., return_full_cov=False).scale` is now a
  `DiagonalLinearOperator`. Use `.as_matrix()` / `.diagonal` rather than assuming a
  dense matrix.
- **Diagonal predict**: `predict(..., "diagonal").scale` is now a
  `DiagonalLinearOperator`. Use `.as_matrix()` / `.diagonal`, not `.matrix`.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`gpjax.summarise(model)`**: render any GPJax pytree (kernel, prior,
  posterior, likelihood, variational family, ...) as a flat `rich` table —
  one row per parameter — showing parameter path, class, constrained value,
  bijector, trainability, shape, and dtype. User-facing abstract bases gain
  `__rich__` and `_repr_mimebundle_` hooks for `rich.print(model)` and
  Jupyter auto-rendering; `repr()` is unchanged. `rich` is now a core
  runtime dependency. An optional `priors` mapping (parameter name → prior,
  e.g. a NumPyro distribution) populates the otherwise-empty Prior column.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`gpjax.state_space` sub-package**: state-space (Markovian) Gaussian
  processes with a square-root Kalman filter (chunked checkpointed scan
  for `O(sqrt(N) · d²)` reverse-mode AD memory) and an RTS smoother.
  Public API:
  - `StateSpacePrior`, `StateSpaceConjugatePosterior`
  - `TruncatedPeriodic` (Solin & Särkkä 2014 truncated-Fourier kernel)
  - `to_sde` singledispatch dispatching kernels to closed-form SDEs
  - `state_space_mll` MLL objective
  - `fit`, `fit_scipy`, `fit_lbfgs` thin wrappers around the
    corresponding `gpjax.fit_*` optimisers
  - Supports `Matern12`, `Matern32`, `Matern52`, `TruncatedPeriodic`,
    and their `SumKernel` compositions on 1-D temporal data.
- **New poe task**: `all-tests-slow` runs long-running numerical and
  memory stress tests opt-in via the `slow` pytest marker.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`gpjax.likelihoods.Gaussian.predict` and
  `gpjax.likelihoods.HeteroscedasticGaussian.predict`** now return
  `gpjax.distributions.GaussianDistribution` (was
  `numpyro.distributions.MultivariateNormal`). For `Gaussian.predict`, the
  diagonal fast path preserves a `lineax.DiagonalLinearOperator` scale; the
  dense path wraps a `lineax.MatrixLinearOperator`.
  `HeteroscedasticGaussian.predict` wraps its (always-dense) covariance in a
  `lineax.MatrixLinearOperator`. Callers relying on
  `MultivariateNormal`-specific attributes (`scale_tril`,
  `precision_matrix`, etc.) must update; callers using `mean`,
  `variance`, `covariance_matrix` are unaffected.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-21

See [`docs/migrations/0.14.0.md`](docs/migrations/0.14.0.md) for full upgrade
instructions.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Module backend**: `flax.nnx.Module` has been replaced with
  `equinox.Module`. Custom kernels, mean functions, likelihoods, and
  variational families that subclassed `nnx.Module` must now subclass
  `eqx.Module` and declare class-level type annotations for every field.
- **Parameter system**: `PositiveReal`, `NonNegativeReal`, `Real`,
  `SigmoidBounded`, and `LowerTriangular` now inherit from
  `paramax.AbstractUnwrappable`. Read a parameter value with
  `param.unwrap()`, or resolve an entire model tree with
  `paramax.unwrap(model)`. `param.value` no longer exists.
- **Fitting API**: `gpx.fit`, `gpx.fit_scipy`, and `gpx.fit_lbfgs` no
  longer accept `params_bijection=` or `trainable=`. Bijection handling
  is automatic; freeze parameters by wrapping them with
  `paramax.non_trainable` via `eqx.tree_at`.
- **`LowerTriangular`** now requires a strictly positive diagonal
  (parameterised by `softplus_lower_cholesky`). Passing a matrix with
  zero or negative diagonal entries produces `NaN` during construction.
- **Linear algebra**: `gpjax.linalg` has been rewritten on top of
  [Lineax](https://docs.kidger.site/lineax/). Kernel `gram()` returns a
  `lineax.AbstractLinearOperator` instead of a `cola.LinearOperator`.
  `PSD`, `psd`, `Dense`, `Diagonal`, `Identity`, `Triangular`,
  `LinearOperator`, `diag`, `solve`, and `lower_cholesky` are removed;
  see the migration guide for Lineax equivalents.
- **Bijectors**: the custom bijector stack has been removed.
  `Parameter` (the old generic base class), `DEFAULT_BIJECTION`,
  `transform(...)`, and `FillTriangularTransform` are gone. Custom
  parameter classes should use `numpyro.distributions.biject_to` with a
  `numpyro.distributions.constraints` object.
- **`register_parameters` removed**. With the Equinox backend, GPJax
  identifies parameter classes through `isinstance` checks on
  `AbstractUnwrappable`, so the decorator is no longer needed.

### Added

- `gpjax.linalg.cholesky_factor` — single-dispatch Cholesky factoriser
  that returns a lower-triangular Lineax operator.
- `gpjax.linalg.add_jitter` — helper for adding a jitter term to a
  covariance operator.
- [`docs/migrations/0.14.0.md`](docs/migrations/0.14.0.md) — upgrade guide from
  0.13.x.

### Removed

- Flax is no longer a runtime dependency. The package `__description__`
  has been updated from "Gaussian processes in JAX and Flax" to
  "Gaussian processes in JAX".
- `cola-ml` is no longer a runtime dependency.

### Dependencies

- Added: `equinox>=0.11`, `paramax>=0.0.5`, `lineax`.
- Removed: `flax`, `cola-ml`.
